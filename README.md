# skills-by-yigitkonur

skills for ai coding agents — one pack, **40 skills** + the internet-researcher agents. review, research, ui/ux audit, mcp & framework builders, browser/device automation, config files, publish. install what you need, skip the rest. no monolith.

> used to be two repos (a main pack + a `-secondary` b-side). they're one now. the old secondary repo is gone — everything lives here.

## install

two ways in. both read the same `skills/` folder, so pick your vibe.

### as claude code plugins (the good way — toggle on/off via `/plugin`)

add the marketplace once:

```
/plugin marketplace add yigitkonur/skills-by-yigitkonur
```

then grab exactly what you want — one skill, a themed bundle, the researcher agents, or everything — and drop it just as fast:

```
/plugin install run-review@yigitkonur          # one skill
/plugin install yk-mcp@yigitkonur              # a themed bundle
/plugin install yk-researchers@yigitkonur      # just the internet-researcher agents
/plugin install yk-everything@yigitkonur       # the whole thing
/plugin uninstall run-review@yigitkonur        # gone
```

installed ≠ enabled. `/plugin` lets you flip stuff on and off without reinstalling — enable what you're working with, mute the rest so it doesn't eat your context. per-skill plugins are named after the skill (`<skill>@yigitkonur`); bundles are the `yk-*` names below.

### with the `skills` cli

```bash
npx -y skills add -y -g yigitkonur/skills-by-yigitkonur                      # full pack
npx -y skills add -y -g yigitkonur/skills-by-yigitkonur/skills/<skill-name>  # single skill
```

per-skill one-liners live in each skill's `INSTALL.md`.

### staying fresh

every push to `main` auto-bumps the version, so `/plugin marketplace update` always pulls the latest skills and agents. you don't chase releases — they chase you.

## notes

- every enabled skill costs context. that's the whole point of shipping per-skill plugins and small bundles instead of one blob — enable what you use.
- the plugin path and the `skills` cli read the same `skills/` files. the marketplace catalog is [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json), generated by `python3 scripts/gen-marketplace.py`; the version comes from [`VERSION`](VERSION) and ci bumps it on every push to `main`.
- naming/taxonomy → [NAMING.md](NAMING.md). structure + contribution checklist → [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- spec: [agentskills.io/specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). plugin/marketplace docs: [code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).
- duplicate skill triggers? known claude code thing ([#27721](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/27721)).

## contributing

see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). new skills use a verb from the [12-verb registry](NAMING.md), pass `python3 scripts/validate-skills.py`, and land in the marketplace via `python3 scripts/gen-marketplace.py`.
