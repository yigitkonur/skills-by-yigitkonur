# Init Devin Review

Generate Devin review configuration from repository evidence. `REVIEW.md` controls what Bug Catcher flags in diffs. `AGENTS.md` controls how Devin should behave while working in the repo. Default to the smallest configuration that meaningfully improves review quality.

## Use this skill when

- setting up Devin Bug Catcher for a repository
- fixing noisy or weak `REVIEW.md` guidance
- deciding whether the repo needs only `REVIEW.md` or both `REVIEW.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- scoping review rules across packages or services in a monorepo

## Core working rules

- Start with the repository, not the scenario library.
- Inspect existing instruction and context files before writing anything: matching `**/REVIEW.md`, `**/AGENTS.md`, `**/CLAUDE.md`, `**/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `agents/rules/**/*.md`, `.cursor/rules/**/*.mdc`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.coderabbit.yaml`, `.coderabbit.yml`, `greptile.json`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `.editorconfig`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `COMPLIANCE.md`, and `.devin/` config files.
- Account for scoped instruction files inside agent-style subdirectories such as `.agents/`, `.devin/`, `.cursor/`, or `.github/` when checking for overlap. Also read `LICENSE` for licensing context (do not duplicate its content).
- Reuse the repo's real paths, libraries, commands, docs, and pain points. Never copy reference text verbatim.
- `REVIEW.md` can live at the root or in scoped subdirectories. `AGENTS.md` can also be scoped, but default to one root file and add scoped `AGENTS.md` only when package-specific execution rules truly diverge.
- Keep `REVIEW.md` focused on reviewable diff issues. Put coding workflow, architecture, and task-execution behavior in `AGENTS.md` only when needed.
- Prefer one strong root `REVIEW.md` over many weak files. Keep root rules cross-cutting and add scoped `REVIEW.md` files only where review concerns truly diverge.
- Do not encode formatter, linter, or CI rules unless Devin adds value beyond existing automation.

## Required workflow

### 1. Scan the repo

Collect only the evidence needed to write grounded rules. Start by identifying the primary language and stack — this determines which artifacts, tools, and risk areas to look for.

Start by changing into the target repo root. If you are working from a shared fixture or sample repository, copy it to a scratch repo/worktree before writing `REVIEW.md` or `AGENTS.md` so the source fixture stays unchanged.

**Language-detection routing:**

| Detect | Then prioritize |
| --- | --- |
| `go.mod` or `Makefile` with Go targets | Go patterns in `references/patterns/common-configurations.md` |
| `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `manage.py` | Python/Django patterns |
| `package.json` with TypeScript | TypeScript patterns |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust patterns |
| `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | Java/Kotlin patterns |

**How to scan:**

```bash
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name "REVIEW.md" -o -name "AGENTS.md" -o -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -name "CONTRIBUTING.md" -o -name ".cursorrules" -o -name ".windsurfrules" -o -name "*.rules" -o -name "*.mdc" -o -name ".coderabbit.yaml" -o -name ".coderabbit.yml" -o -name "greptile.json" \) | sort
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.toml" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.yaml" \) | head -50
[ -f README.md ] && head -30 README.md
ls -la .github/ .cursor/ .windsurf/ .agents/ agents/ .devin/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "lint\|format\|check" package.json Makefile pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

- Read the dependency manifest first: `package.json`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`
- For monorepos (>5,000 files), limit deep scanning to top two directory levels plus any `apps/`, `packages/`, `services/`, `cmd/`, or `internal/` subdirectories
- Check for CI configuration: `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `Makefile`
- When root and scoped instruction files overlap, do not guess at undocumented precedence. Keep root files cross-cutting, make scoped files local, and remove contradictions instead of relying on overrides.

**What to collect:**

- **structure**: single-service repo or monorepo; top-level directories (`apps/`, `packages/`, `services/`, `cmd/`, `internal/`, `src/`)
- **stack**: primary language(s), frameworks, data/storage layer (ORM, direct DB, object storage, key-value stores), transport/runtime (HTTP framework, gRPC, message queues, CLI), test tooling (unit runner, integration, E2E, benchmarks)
- **existing instructions**: matching `**/REVIEW.md`, `**/AGENTS.md`, `**/CLAUDE.md`, `**/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `agents/rules/**/*.md`, `.cursor/rules/**/*.mdc`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.coderabbit.yaml`, `.coderabbit.yml`, `greptile.json`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `.editorconfig`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `COMPLIANCE.md`, and `.devin/` config files. Read `LICENSE` for licensing context — don't duplicate its content.
- **contracts and docs**: OpenAPI/Swagger specs, Prisma/Django/SQLAlchemy schema, `go.mod`, ADRs, architecture docs, security docs, design docs in `docs/`
- **enforcement already present**: the repo's existing linters, formatters, CI, or SAST tools (e.g. Semgrep, Bandit, gosec, CodeQL) — check actual config files rather than assuming which tools are used
- **recurring risk areas**: detect which apply by scanning for related code and config:
  - `grep -r "password\|secret\|token\|key\|credential" --include="*.env*"` → secrets handling
  - `find . -name "migrations" -o -name "migrate"` → schema migration safety
  - `grep -r "mutex\|lock\|sync\.\|goroutine\|thread"` → concurrency patterns
  - `grep -r "authorize\|permission\|role\|rbac\|pbac"` → auth/permissions
  - Also check for: payment/billing modules, IPC/API boundaries, generated code, async task queues (Celery, BullMQ), distributed coordination (locks, consensus), data serialization boundaries
  - **Systems-programming risks**: goroutine/thread safety, race conditions, memory management (unsafe blocks, manual allocation), distributed coordination, file/network I/O error handling

### 2. Choose the file plan

| Situation | Output |
| --- | --- |
| Single service or one shared review model | Root `REVIEW.md` |
| Monorepo with cross-cutting rules plus package-specific risks | Root `REVIEW.md` + scoped `REVIEW.md` only in divergent directories |
| User asks for Devin coding or task behavior too, and one execution model fits the repo | Root `REVIEW.md` + root `AGENTS.md` |
| Repo has package-specific execution rules that would make one `AGENTS.md` contradictory or bloated | Root `REVIEW.md` + root `AGENTS.md`, plus scoped `AGENTS.md` only in the divergent directories |
| Existing `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` already covers coding behavior | Usually `REVIEW.md` only; extend or align instead of duplicating |

Default to `REVIEW.md` only unless the request or repo evidence clearly calls for `AGENTS.md`.

When multiple rows match, choose the row that produces the least output. Start minimal — add scoped files later.

**First deployment?** Start with `REVIEW.md` only. Run 5 PRs. Audit findings. Then add `AGENTS.md` if needed.

### 3. Split concerns correctly

| Concern | `REVIEW.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What Bug Catcher should flag in diffs | ✅ | ❌ |
| What files or changes to ignore | ✅ | ❌ |
| Coding standards, architecture, workflow, dependency choices | ❌ | ✅ |
| Test, run, or commit expectations for Devin | ❌ | ✅ |

Rule of thumb: if the statement is about **reviewing a diff**, it belongs in `REVIEW.md`. If it is about **how Devin or contributors should work**, it belongs in `AGENTS.md`.

### 4. Draft from evidence

Before writing, find the closest scenario in `references/scenarios.md` and use it as your starting template. Adapt — don't copy.

If no scenario is a close fit, choose the nearest one by primary language/runtime and reuse only its section order and severity style. Drop stack-specific rules that do not match the repo instead of inventing new framework guidance from the template.

When writing `REVIEW.md`:

1. Put high-signal sections near the top. Preferred order: `Critical Areas` → `Security` → `Conventions` → `Performance` → `Patterns` → `Ignore` → `Testing`.
2. Reference real repo details in every important section: paths, middleware, libraries, commands, docs, or contracts.
3. Use severity intentionally:
   - severe bug language: `must never`, `always required`, `prohibited`
   - important but not always severe: `use X instead of Y`, `do not`
   - lower-priority guidance: `prefer`, `consider`, `watch for`
4. Focus Good/Bad code examples on the top 2–3 highest-risk sections only — not every section needs them.
5. Add an `Ignore` section using glob patterns (e.g., `*.generated.*`, `**/migrations/`, `*_test.go`, `**/__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `*.lock`) so generated files, lockfiles, build output, snapshots, and similar noise do not consume review bandwidth.
6. Use the closest scenario from `references/scenarios.md` as structural inspiration for your stack, then rewrite every rule against actual repo evidence.

When writing `AGENTS.md`:

- prefer one root file; add scoped `AGENTS.md` only when package-level workflow, architecture, or dependency rules truly diverge
- keep root guidance cross-cutting and scoped guidance local to that subtree
- focus on architecture, workflow, dependencies, file organization, testing, and communication expectations
- do not restate bug-finding rules that already belong in `REVIEW.md`

## Do this, not that

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Extend or align with existing instruction files | Overwrite or contradict them blindly |
| Reference actual paths and libraries like `src/auth/`, `openapi.yaml`, `portable-pty`, `rusqlite`, `NextAuth`, or `select_related()` | Write generic advice like "validate inputs" or "be secure" |
| Use scoped `REVIEW.md` only for real package or service differences | Copy the same root rules into every subdirectory |
| Check the repo's actual linter config to confirm what's enforced, then omit those rules | Assume ESLint/Prettier — the repo may use Biome, Ruff, or golangci-lint |
| Keep `REVIEW.md` compact, usually 100-300 lines and under 500 max | Cram every possible rule into one file |
| Use scenario and pattern references as raw material | Paste scenario text verbatim |

## Validation checklist

Before returning any configuration, verify:

- the front-loaded sections match the repo's highest-risk areas
- rules are specific enough to test against a diff
- no obvious overlap with the repo's existing linters, formatters, CI, or SAST tools
- ignore patterns match actual generated and build files in the repo
- monorepo scoped files add new package-specific guidance instead of duplicating root rules
- `AGENTS.md` is only included when agent-behavior guidance is truly needed
- no contradictions across overlapping `REVIEW.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or editor/review rule files
- `REVIEW.md` stays lean enough for Bug Catcher to focus

## Output requirements

When asked to generate files, return:

1. a short file plan or tree
2. If filesystem access exists, write the files into the target repo first unless the user explicitly asked for draft-only output
3. each file as a complete markdown block
4. brief notes tying major sections to repository evidence
5. a simple verification path: submit a test PR to see Bug Catcher's response, or use `devinreview.com` to preview rule behavior, or run `npx devin-review` locally — see `references/setup/getting-started.md` for setup details and `references/customization/rules-and-exclusions.md` for tuning exclusions after the first run

## Recovery loops

- **Too much noise:** shorten the file, add or expand `Ignore`, delete vague rules, and remove rules already enforced elsewhere. See `references/customization/rules-and-exclusions.md` and `references/troubleshooting/common-issues.md`.
- **Missing real bugs:** move critical rules higher, add path-specific critical areas, tighten phrasing, and add repo-accurate examples. See `references/review-md/format-and-directives.md` and `references/troubleshooting/common-issues.md`.
- **Monorepo confusion:** keep root rules cross-cutting; put only package-specific risks in scoped files; do not rely on precedence to resolve contradictions. See `references/patterns/common-configurations.md` and `references/review-spec.md`.
- **`REVIEW.md` vs `AGENTS.md` overlap:** move diff-catching rules back to `REVIEW.md`; keep coding workflow in `AGENTS.md`. See `references/agents-md/configuration.md`.
- **Need a starting pattern for a known stack:** use the closest scenario as inspiration, then rewrite it against the repo. `references/scenarios.md` covers TypeScript backends, Next.js sites and dashboards, Django APIs, Tauri apps, MCP servers, Python `mcp-use`, and monorepos.

## Reference routing

| Need | Workflow phase | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| instruction-file patterns, scoping boundaries, and review runtime behavior | Step 1 — scanning, Step 2 — planning | `references/review-spec.md` |
| section order, phrasing, weighting, monorepo `REVIEW.md` behavior | Step 4 — drafting | `references/review-md/format-and-directives.md` |
| `AGENTS.md` structure and file-split decisions | Step 2–3 — planning | `references/agents-md/configuration.md` |
| noise reduction, exclusions, severity tuning | Recovery / tuning | `references/customization/rules-and-exclusions.md` |
| reusable security, performance, framework, and monorepo patterns | Step 1 — scanning, Step 4 — drafting | `references/patterns/common-configurations.md` |
| full stack examples to adapt, not copy | Step 4 — drafting | `references/scenarios.md` |
| noisy reviews, missed bugs, and triggering/debug issues | Recovery / tuning | `references/troubleshooting/common-issues.md` |
| install, enrollment, and verification paths | Setup / verification | `references/setup/getting-started.md` |

## Final reminder

The best Devin review config is not the longest one. It is the smallest repo-grounded set of instructions that makes Bug Catcher focus on the bugs your team actually cares about.
