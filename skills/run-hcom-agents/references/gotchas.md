# hcom Script Gotchas

Issues discovered during real testing with hcom v0.7.6 on 2026-03-24. Every entry below was hit during actual test runs.

## Hooks Preflight (mandatory)

Before launching any headless workflow:

```bash
hcom hooks
hcom status
# Confirm the target tool shows installed hooks
```

If the target tool is missing hooks:

```bash
hcom hooks add codex
hcom status
```

If `hcom hooks add <tool>` fails or `hcom status` still does not show the hooks as installed, stop and capture diagnostics. Do not continue to launch scripts in a half-configured environment.

Use these diagnostics before retrying:

```bash
hcom hooks
hcom status --logs
hcom status --json
```

- `hcom hooks` gives the fastest installed/not-installed check.
- `hcom status --logs` prints the recent warning/error lines and the log file path.
- `hcom status --json` shows per-tool `hooks`, `installed`, and `settings_path` fields so you know which config file hcom tried to modify.

## Script Hangs Forever

**Cause:** Missing `--go` flag on `hcom 1 claude`, `hcom kill`, or any command that normally prompts for confirmation.

**Fix:** Always include `--go` on every hcom launch and kill command in scripts.

```bash
# WRONG - hangs waiting for user confirmation
hcom 1 claude --tag worker --headless --hcom-prompt "..."
hcom kill luna

# RIGHT
hcom 1 claude --tag worker --go --headless --hcom-prompt "..."
hcom kill luna --go
```

## Agent Not Receiving Messages

**Diagnosis steps:**
```bash
hcom list                    # Is agent alive? What status?
hcom events --last 5         # Was message actually sent?
hcom events --agent luna     # What has luna seen recently?
```

**Common causes and fixes:**

| Cause | How to detect | Fix |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| Agent already stopped | `hcom list` shows inactive/missing | Check timing; agent may finish before message arrives |
| Agent has not bound session yet | `hcom list` shows "launching" | Wait: `hcom events --wait 30 --idle "$name"` |
| Wrong @-mention syntax | Event shows empty `delivered_to` array | Use `@tag-` prefix, not raw 4-letter name |
| No matching thread | Agent sees no messages | Both sides must use exact same `--thread` value |
| Message scope mismatch | Event `scope` is "mentions" but agent not in `mentions` array | Verify @mention matches agent name or tag |
| Identity binding failed | Agent not in `instances` table | Check `HCOM_PROCESS_ID` env var propagation |

## Codex Agent Gets stale_cleanup

**Root cause:** Codex session binding happens on the first `codex-notify` hook event (agent-turn-complete), which takes 5-10 seconds. The hcom cleanup process runs every 30 seconds. If Codex does nothing within 30 seconds of launching, the placeholder instance is cleaned up as stale.

**Technical details:**
- Codex has only 1 hook (`codex-notify`) triggered on agent-turn-complete
- Session binding happens via `rebind_instance_session()` in the codex hook handler
- The cleanup function `cleanup_stale_placeholders()` purges instances with status_context="new" that have not bound within the timeout
- Unlike Claude (which binds immediately on SessionStart), Codex binding is delayed

**Fix:**
```bash
# After launching Codex, always wait for idle before sending messages
launch_out=$(hcom 1 codex --tag eng --go --headless --hcom-prompt "..." 2>&1)
track_launch "$launch_out"
codex_name=$(echo "$launch_out" | grep '^Names: ' | sed 's/^Names: //' | tr -d ' ')

# This blocks until Codex's session binds and it enters idle/listening state
hcom events --wait 30 --idle "$codex_name" $name_arg >/dev/null 2>&1
# NOW safe to send messages
```

**If Codex is already cleaned up:** You will see no instance in `hcom list`. The only fix is to relaunch.

## Messages Leaking Between Workflows

**Cause:** No `--thread` isolation. Without threads, all messages in a broadcast scope reach all agents.

**Fix:** Every workflow must use a unique thread ID:
```bash
thread="my-workflow-$(date +%s)"
# All messages in this workflow use --thread
hcom send @worker- --thread "$thread" -- "task"
hcom events --wait 120 --sql "msg_thread='${thread}' AND msg_text LIKE '%DONE%'"
```

**Why timestamps work:** `$(date +%s)` gives epoch seconds. Even if two workflows start in the same second, different thread prefixes (e.g., "review-" vs "ensemble-") prevent collision.

## SQL LIKE Matching Behavior

`msg_text LIKE '%APPROVED%'` also matches `"approved": true` in JSON because SQLite LIKE is case-insensitive for ASCII characters. This is actually convenient for most use cases.

**Precision matching when needed:**
```bash
# Case-sensitive match (use GLOB instead of LIKE)
hcom events --sql "msg_text GLOB '*APPROVED*'"

# Match exact word boundary
hcom events --sql "msg_text LIKE '% APPROVED%' OR msg_text LIKE 'APPROVED%'"
```

## hcom events --wait Exit Code

Returns 0 on both match AND timeout. You cannot use exit code to distinguish. Check output instead:

```bash
result=$(hcom events --wait 60 --sql "msg_thread='${thread}' AND msg_text LIKE '%DONE%'" $name_arg 2>/dev/null)
if [[ -n "$result" ]]; then
  echo "MATCHED"
else
  echo "TIMEOUT - no matching event within 60s"
  hcom events --sql "msg_thread='${thread}'" --last 20 $name_arg 2>/dev/null || true
  hcom status 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

## Agent Name Capture

Names are random 4-letter CVCV words (luna, nemo, bali, kiwi, cora, etc.). Never hardcode them. Always parse from launch output:

```bash
launch_out=$(hcom 1 claude --tag worker --go --headless --hcom-prompt "..." 2>&1)
track_launch "$launch_out"
name=$(echo "$launch_out" | grep '^Names: ' | sed 's/^Names: //' | tr -d ' ')
# $name is now "luna" or "nemo" etc.
echo "Launched: $name"
```

**For batch launches (multiple agents):**
```bash
launch_out=$(hcom 3 claude --tag team --go --headless --hcom-prompt "..." 2>&1)
# Names: luna nemo bali (space-separated)
names=$(echo "$launch_out" | grep '^Names: ' | sed 's/^Names: //')
for n in $names; do
  LAUNCHED_NAMES+=("$n")
  echo "Launched: $n"
done
```

## Agent Cleanup on Error

Without cleanup, orphan headless agents run indefinitely consuming resources:

```bash
LAUNCHED_NAMES=()
track_launch() {
  local names=$(echo "$1" | grep '^Names: ' | sed 's/^Names: //')
  for n in $names; do LAUNCHED_NAMES+=("$n"); done
}
cleanup() {
  for name in "${LAUNCHED_NAMES[@]}"; do
    hcom kill "$name" --go 2>/dev/null || true
  done
}
trap cleanup ERR

# ... your script logic ...

# At end, clear trap and clean up normally
trap - ERR
for name in "${LAUNCHED_NAMES[@]}"; do
  hcom kill "$name" --go 2>/dev/null || true
done
```

**Use `hcom kill` not `hcom stop`:** Kill sends SIGTERM and closes the terminal pane. Stop preserves the session for resume but leaves the pane open.

**Kill escalation sequence:**
1. Close terminal pane via preset command (if available)
2. SIGTERM to process group (negative PID = killpg, kills entire subtree)
3. Wait 5 seconds for graceful shutdown
4. Escalate to SIGKILL if process is still alive
5. Wait 2 more seconds, drain PTY to prevent deadlock

## Broadcast vs Mention Routing

**Broadcast (no @mentions):**
```bash
hcom send -- "everyone sees this"  # No @ prefix = broadcast
```

**Mention (targeted):**
```bash
hcom send @luna -- "only luna sees this"         # Direct mention
hcom send @worker- -- "all workers see this"     # Tag prefix
hcom send @luna @nova -- "luna and nova see this" # Multiple mentions
```

**Common mistake:** Forgetting `--` before the message text. Without `--`, the message text might be parsed as flags.

## Heartbeat and Stale Detection

Agents are marked stale (inactive) if their heartbeat is not updated:

| Mode | Threshold | What updates heartbeat |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| With TCP notify | 35 seconds | Hook fires, hcom command, delivery thread |
| Without TCP notify | 10 seconds | Hook fires, hcom command |
| Activity timeout | 5 minutes | Any status change |
| Launch timeout | 30 seconds | Session binding event |

**Wake grace period:** After system sleep/wake, hcom gives a 60-second grace period where heartbeat checks are suspended. This prevents mass stale detection after laptop lid close/open.

## Intent System Misuse

**Wrong:** Not using intents, causing agents to over-respond:
```bash
hcom send @worker- -- "FYI: I updated the config"  # No intent = ambiguous
```

**Right:**
```bash
hcom send @worker- --intent inform -- "FYI: I updated the config"   # Worker won't respond
hcom send @worker- --intent request -- "Review this code"           # Worker must respond
hcom send @worker- --intent ack -- "Got it, thanks"                 # Worker ignores
```

The bootstrap teaches agents: `request -> always respond`, `inform -> respond only if useful`, `ack -> don't respond`.

## Thread vs Reply-To vs Scope

| Mechanism | When to use | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `--thread` | Group related messages | Creates namespace for conversation isolation |
| `--reply-to <id>` | Reference specific message | Links message to an event ID |
| `@mentions` | Target specific agents | Controls delivery scope |
| Broadcast (no @) | Everyone needs to see | Delivers to all active/listening agents |

## TTY/PTY Issues

**Agent shows as "blocked" in hcom list:**
- Cause: Approval prompt detected (OSC9 sequence) or output unstable
- Fix: Agent needs user to approve a tool call, or the PTY delivery detected instability

**Agent terminal pane does not close on kill:**
- Cause: Terminal preset close command failed or pane ID was not captured
- Fix: Manually close the terminal tab/pane. Check `hcom config terminal` for preset.

**Codex message injection fails silently:**
- Cause: Gate conditions not met (prompt not empty, user activity, approval pending)
- Fix: Wait for agent to be in "listening" status before sending
