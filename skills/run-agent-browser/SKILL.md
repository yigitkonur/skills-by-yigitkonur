# Browser Automation with agent-browser

Use this skill when the task should be executed through the `agent-browser` CLI. If the user explicitly wants `playwright-cli`, use `run-playwright` instead. If the task is diagnosis in DevTools rather than browser automation, use the relevant debug skill.

## Trigger boundaries

Use this skill for:
- terminal-driven browser automation with `agent-browser`
- form filling, login flows, data extraction, screenshots, and DOM-grounded web app checks
- multi-tab or multi-session workflows where ref snapshots and deterministic verification matter

Do not use this skill for:
- tasks explicitly asking for `playwright-cli`, Browserbase `browse`, or another browser CLI
- static research that does not require active browser interaction
- DevTools-first debugging or profiling unless the task still centers on `agent-browser`

## Non-negotiable operating rules

1. **Observe before acting.** After open, navigation, tab switch, popup, frame change, or major click, wait for state and run `snapshot -i` before choosing the next action.
2. **Reuse the current session by default.** Do not spawn a new session just because you changed pages.
3. **Prefer a new tab over a new window.** Use `window new` only when the site or task truly requires a separate window.
4. **Track focus before every action.** Know the active tab, URL, and title before clicking or typing.
5. **Verify after every meaningful interaction.** Check URL, title, text, value, visibility, checked state, or `diff snapshot` before assuming success.
6. **Treat DOM evidence as the source of truth.** Screenshots are supporting evidence for layout, failures, or human review.
7. **Close only what you opened.** Leave pre-existing tabs, windows, and reusable sessions alone unless the user asked to close them.
8. **Keep output scoped.** Prefer `snapshot -i`, scoped snapshots, `--json`, `get text`, and `get attr` over verbose full-page output.

## Default loop: observe → act → verify → clean up

### 1) Establish session and baseline

- Verify agent-browser is available before your first command. Run `agent-browser --version` (or `npx agent-browser --version`). If the command is not found, install with `npm install -g agent-browser`.
- If you may be joining an existing browser context, inspect it first:

```bash
agent-browser tab
agent-browser get url
agent-browser get title
agent-browser snapshot -i
```

- Reuse the default session for a single continuous task.
- Use `--session SESSION_NAME` only for isolated concurrent work.
- Use `--session-name SESSION_NAME` only when deliberate persistence across runs is valuable and safe.

### 2) Navigate or focus the correct page

- Open the target URL or switch to the correct tab.
- After any focus change, verify focus immediately:

```bash
agent-browser tab
agent-browser get url
agent-browser get title
agent-browser snapshot -i
```

- Never assume a newly opened tab, popup, or site-driven redirect left you on the expected page.

### 3) Inspect before interacting

- Use `snapshot -i` first. Note: `snapshot -i` shows only interactive elements (links, buttons, inputs, checkboxes). Non-interactive text (headings, paragraphs, spans) is invisible in this view.
- Use `snapshot -i --json` when you need structured extraction or machine-readable branching logic. The JSON schema is `{success, data: {origin, refs: {refId: {name, role, ...}}, snapshot: string}, error}` — access refs via `.data.refs`, not `.elements[]`.
- For data extraction from non-interactive text, use `get text CSS_SELECTOR` (must match exactly one element) or `eval --stdin` with a heredoc for multi-element extraction.
- If expected UI elements are missing from `snapshot -i`, the page may use custom components (dropdowns, popovers, accordions) whose children only appear after clicking the trigger. Click the likely trigger → re-snapshot → verify new elements appeared.
- Use `screenshot --annotate` only when visual layout, canvas content, or element disambiguation matters.
- Selector priority:
  1. `@refs` from `snapshot -i`
  2. semantic `find`
  3. CSS selectors
  4. XPath only as a last resort

### 4) Interact one state change at a time

- Prefer small, verifiable steps over long blind chains.
- Chain commands only when you do not need intermediate output.
- After any action that can change DOM or focus, wait and re-snapshot before reusing refs.
- Refs are invalid after navigation, SPA route changes, modal expansion, dynamic loading, tab switching, and many form submissions.
- Use `agent-browser back` to return to the previous page (browser back button). Prefer `back` over re-navigating with `open URL` when you need to preserve history or avoid redundant loads.
- Note: `check` and `uncheck` return the new checked state (`true`/`false`) rather than `✓ Done`. This is expected.

### 5) Verify the result before moving on

Use at least one deterministic check after each major interaction:
- `agent-browser get url`
- `agent-browser get title`
- `agent-browser get text REF_OR_SELECTOR` — selector must match exactly one element; for multiple matches use `eval --stdin` with JS
- `agent-browser get value REF_OR_SELECTOR`
- `agent-browser is visible REF`
- `agent-browser is checked REF` — works for both checkboxes and radio buttons
- `agent-browser diff snapshot`
- If `snapshot -i` returns `(no interactive elements)` (e.g. after form submission to a raw response page), verify with `get text body` for page content or `get url` / `get title` for navigation confirmation.
- For visual verification or archival: `agent-browser screenshot /tmp/descriptive-name.png`

Capture screenshots only when you need:
- visual evidence for a human
- layout or styling confirmation
- failure triage
- annotated element mapping

### 6) Clean up deliberately

- If you opened auxiliary tabs, close them with `agent-browser tab close INDEX` (get the index from `tab` listing) and return to the original tab.
- If you started isolated sessions, close those sessions when their work is done.
- If you used persisted state or state files, secure them and avoid leaving secrets behind.
- If you opened a fresh disposable default session for the task, close it at the end.

## Session, tab, and window hygiene

### Session choice

- Same task, same auth context: stay in the current or default session.
- Concurrent or role-separated work: use named `--session` sessions.
- Intentional long-lived login reuse across runs: use `--session-name`, `auth`, or `state save/load`.

### Tab and window rules

- Prefer `tab new URL` for side routes, docs, exports, or OAuth flows that should not disturb the current page.
- Prefer switching back to the original tab instead of reopening pages from scratch.
- Use `window new` only if the site truly requires a separate window or the user asked for one.
- After `tab new`, `tab INDEX`, or any action that opens a popup or new tab, verify focus with `tab`, `get url`, `get title`, then `snapshot -i`.
- Treat tab switches like navigation for ref lifecycle purposes: re-snapshot after every switch.

### Cleanup rules

- Record which tab or session you started in.
- Record which tabs, windows, or sessions you created.
- Close only the ones you created.
- If the browser context pre-existed, leave it in a sane state and avoid shutting it down unnecessarily.

## Do this, not that

| Do this | Not that |
|---|---|
| Reuse the current session when the task stays in the same auth and state context | Start a brand-new session for every page |
| Open a new tab for side work, then verify focus | Spawn unnecessary windows or assume the new tab is active |
| Run `snapshot -i` before interaction and after every major change | Reuse stale refs after navigation or tab switches |
| Use `get text`, `get value`, `is visible`, `diff snapshot`, and URL/title checks | Treat screenshots as the only proof an action worked |
| Use `snapshot -i --json` or targeted getters for extraction | Pull huge raw outputs when a narrow query would do |
| Close only tabs and sessions you created | Blindly run `agent-browser close` on a shared or reusable context |

## Recovery paths

- **Ref not found or wrong element:** re-check focus, then `snapshot -i` again. If the page changed, old refs are stale. If the page is crowded, scope the snapshot or use `find`.
- **Multiple elements match a CSS selector:** `get text CSS_SELECTOR` requires exactly one match (strict mode). For multi-element extraction, use `eval --stdin` with a heredoc to run a JS query:
  ```bash
  agent-browser eval --stdin <<'EVALEOF'
  Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.item-title')).map(el => el.textContent.trim()).slice(0, 10);
  EVALEOF
  ```
- **Unexpected redirect or login screen:** verify URL and title first, then decide whether to load saved state, use auth vault, or continue with a login flow.
- **Slow or flaky page:** use explicit waits, increase timeout if needed, then re-snapshot.
- **Too much snapshot output:** use `snapshot -i`, `snapshot -i --json`, scoped snapshots, or targeted getters instead of full page dumps.
- **Stale daemon or broken session:** try `agent-browser close`; if that fails, follow `references/troubleshooting.md`.
- **Sensitive operations needed:** before `eval`, downloads, state persistence, storage writes, cookies, network routing, or unsafe flags, read `references/safety.md` and narrow scope first.

## Final reminder

This SKILL.md is the steering layer. Keep the live loop disciplined:
1. establish session and focus
2. observe
3. act
4. verify
5. record evidence only as needed
6. clean up only what you changed

When in doubt, stop acting, inspect state again, and route into the smallest relevant reference instead of guessing.
