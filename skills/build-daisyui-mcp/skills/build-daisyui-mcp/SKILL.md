# build-daisyui-mcp

Use this skill as the operating layer for daisyUI 5 work with the `daisyui-blueprint` MCP tools. Keep `SKILL.md` lean: choose the correct workflow, fetch only the references you need, and keep bulky detail in `references/`.

## Use this skill for

- Building or refactoring UI with daisyUI 5 + Tailwind v4
- Converting a Figma frame or screenshot into daisyUI code
- Choosing the right snippet category: `components`, `component-examples`, `layouts`, `templates`, or `themes`
- Generating or adapting a custom daisyUI theme from brand colors, images, or existing UI

## Do not use this skill for

- Pure Tailwind work with no daisyUI goal
- UI libraries other than daisyUI
- Generic design discussion that does not need daisyUI code, snippets, or themes

## Runtime prerequisites

This skill has two operating modes. Choose one before composing UI:

- **Snippet-driven mode (preferred):** `daisyui-blueprint-daisyUI-Snippets` is available, and `daisyui-blueprint-Figma-to-daisyUI` is available when the task starts from Figma.
- **Reference-only fallback:** the MCP tools are unavailable, but the task is simple enough to build from `references/component-catalog.md` plus `references/integration/tailwind-v4-setup.md` without guessing snippet keys.

Sanity-check snippet-driven mode before real work with one tiny fetch:

```json
{ "components": { "button": true } }
```

- Send that exact JSON object to `daisyui-blueprint-daisyUI-Snippets`.
- If that succeeds, continue with snippet-driven workflows.
- If it fails and the task depends on snippet discovery, templates, or Figma extraction, stop and ask the user to enable the MCP tools instead of guessing.
- If it fails and the task is a small static page or component, switch to the reference-only fallback.

**Reference-only fallback workflow**

1. Confirm the target already has daisyUI 5 + Tailwind v4 wired up, or use the CDN/static setup in `references/integration/tailwind-v4-setup.md`.
2. Build only from documented class names and markup patterns in `references/component-catalog.md` plus the smallest relevant workflow or pattern reference.
3. Do not guess snippet keys, template names, or hidden component variants in fallback mode. If the task depends on those, stop and ask for MCP access.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Nested object syntax only** for `daisyui-blueprint-daisyUI-Snippets`. Arrays fail silently.
2. **Fetch before guessing.** If you do not know a valid class or example key, fetch the component reference first. Guessing class names is the #1 source of broken output.
3. **Batch requests, max ~8 items per call.** Get all needed snippets in one call; do not fetch one component at a time. But keep each call under ~8 items — larger batches produce 15–26 KB responses that can overflow context.
4. **Use the right category.** `components` is reference data (class names, parts, modifiers), not copy-paste HTML. `component-examples` is working markup. `themes` returns CSS, not HTML.
5. **Start page work from `templates` (preferred) or `layouts`.** Templates give a complete starting point; layouts give a shell. Do not assemble full pages from many isolated component guesses.
6. **For Figma, always follow** `FETCH → ANALYZE → GET SNIPPETS → BUILD`. Never skip analysis.
7. **Use semantic daisyUI colors** (`primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `neutral`, `base-*`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`) and `*-content` variants on themed surfaces.
8. **Do not use `dark:` for daisyUI semantic colors.** Themes already adapt them. Only use `dark:` for custom Tailwind utility classes outside daisyUI's theme system.
9. **Prefer CSS-only daisyUI interaction patterns** unless app-specific behavior truly requires custom JS:
   - drawer → checkbox toggle (use `is-drawer-open:` / `is-drawer-close:` variants for visibility)
   - modal → `<dialog>` with `.modal-open` or JS `.showModal()`
   - dropdown → `<details>` or popover API
   - tabs/steppers → daisyUI radio/tab patterns
10. **Stay on daisyUI v5 syntax** (`fieldset`, `dock`, `tabs-lift`, `card-border`, no `input-bordered`, no `form-control`).
11. **Load only the 1–3 references needed for the active task.** Do not dump the entire skill into context.
12. **Adapt output to the target framework.** For React/Next.js: `class` → `className`, self-close void elements (`<img />`, `<input />`), `for` → `htmlFor`, `tabindex` → `tabIndex`. For Vue: use `:class` bindings. For Svelte: use `class:` directives.

**Positive v5 form baseline**

```html
<fieldset class="fieldset">
  <legend class="fieldset-legend">Profile</legend>
  <input class="input" placeholder="Name" />
  <select class="select"><option>Role</option></select>
  <textarea class="textarea" placeholder="Notes"></textarea>
  <p class="fieldset-label">Helper text or validation hint</p>
</fieldset>
```

```jsonc
// ✅ Correct
{
  "components": { "button": true, "card": true },
  "component-examples": { "card.card": true }
}

// ❌ Wrong — arrays fail silently with no error
{ "components": ["button", "card"] }
{ "snippets": ["components/button"] }
```

## Choose the right tool or snippet category first

| Need | Use | Key rule |
|---|---|---|
| Validate classes, parts, modifiers, or discover example names | `components` | Start here when unsure |
| Copy-paste markup for a known pattern | `component-examples` | Fetch only the 1–3 best matches |
| Get a page shell with placeholders | `layouts` | Best starting point for dashboards, sidebars, app shells |
| Start from a full page | `templates` | Use for login/dashboard/full-page acceleration |
| Get theme variables or color-system reference | `themes` | Returns CSS/config, not component HTML |
| Extract structure from a Figma design | `daisyui-blueprint-Figma-to-daisyUI` | Returns a node tree only; always follow with snippets |

**Mix categories in one call** when you already know what you need:

```json
{
  "layouts": { "responsive-collapsible-drawer-sidebar": true },
  "components": { "navbar": true, "card": true, "table": true },
  "component-examples": {
    "navbar.responsive-dropdown-menu-on-small-screen-center-menu-on-large-screen": true,
    "table.table-with-visual-elements": true
  },
  "themes": { "colors": true }
}
```

## Common starting keys for page work

| Request | Start here |
|---|---|
| Admin/dashboard page with complete content blocks | `templates.dashboard` |
| Login or auth page | `templates.login-form` |
| Persistent sidebar that can collapse to icon-only | `layouts.responsive-collapsible-drawer-sidebar` |
| Standard responsive app shell with off-canvas sidebar on mobile | `layouts.responsive-offcanvas-drawer-sidebar` |

## Route to the correct workflow

> **Priority rule — first match wins.** Walk the table top to bottom; stop at the first row that matches the request. If the request spans multiple rows (e.g., "Figma design with forms"), handle the primary workflow first, then load secondary references.

| Request shape | Do this first | Then load |
|---|---|---|
| Setup or install daisyUI / Tailwind v4 | Read setup docs | `references/integration/tailwind-v4-setup.md` |
| MCP server missing or Figma auth/setup issue | Fix tool setup before composing UI | `references/tool-api-reference.md` |
| Migrating from daisyUI v4 | Read migration docs before writing code | `references/integration/v4-to-v5-migration.md` |
| Single component or section | Fetch `components` first, then targeted `component-examples` | `references/common-mistakes.md` |
| Full page, dashboard, auth screen, landing page | Start from `templates` (preferred) or `layouts` | `references/workflows/component-composition.md`, `references/workflows/responsive-layouts.md` |
| Figma URL present | Run the Figma workflow below | `references/workflows/figma-to-code.md`, `references/tool-api-reference.md` |
| Screenshot or image mockup | Run the screenshot workflow below | `references/workflows/screenshot-to-code.md`, `references/common-mistakes.md`, `references/prompts/screenshot-prompt.md` |
| Brand colors, image-to-theme, dark mode, theme request | Run the theme workflow below | `references/workflows/theme-generation.md`, `references/theming/custom-themes.md`, `references/theme-and-colors.md`, `references/prompts/image-to-theme-prompt.md` |
| Form-heavy UI | Load form patterns before composing | `references/patterns/form-patterns.md` |
| Navbar, menu, drawer, tabs, dock, breadcrumbs | Load navigation patterns before composing | `references/patterns/navigation-patterns.md` |
| Bootstrap or raw Tailwind conversion | Use the relevant conversion workflow | `references/workflows/bootstrap-conversion.md`, `references/workflows/tailwind-optimization.md`, `references/prompts/bootstrap-prompt.md`, `references/prompts/tailwind-prompt.md` |
| Prompt crafting or multi-step chaining | Load prompt guides | `references/prompts/prompt-engineering.md`, `references/prompts/prompt-chaining.md` |

## Workflow — component or page composition

1. **Decide scope and starting point.**
   - Single component/section → fetch `components` reference, then targeted `component-examples`.
   - Full page/app shell → fetch a `template` (preferred) or `layout` first. Never build a full page from scratch when a template exists.
2. **Fetch reference data before writing any markup.**
   - For each component you plan to use, verify its valid classes via `components` category.
   - Batch related components in one MCP call (~8 items max).
   - If you need exact example keys, fetch `components` first to discover names, then fetch `component-examples`.
3. **Fetch only targeted examples** for complex pieces: responsive navbars, drawers with icon-only collapsed state, data tables, pricing cards, multi-step forms.
4. **Compose from the outside in** — this is the assembly order, not optional:
   1. Page shell (template or layout)
   2. Navigation (navbar, sidebar/drawer, breadcrumbs)
   3. Main content blocks (hero, stat grids, card grids, tables)
   4. Detail components (badges, tooltips, modals, toasts)
5. **Apply semantic colors and responsive utilities** after structure is correct. Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoint prefixes for responsive behavior.
6. **If the page is branded**, do theme work before final polish so semantic colors resolve correctly.

> **Steering — page composition pitfalls from real usage:**
> - Dashboard stat grids: use CSS grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4`) not flexbox for even columns.
> - Drawer checkbox toggle: the `<input type="checkbox">` must be a sibling of `.drawer-side`, not nested inside content. Use `is-drawer-open:` and `is-drawer-close:` variants for show/hide behavior.
> - If a UI element has no daisyUI equivalent (charts, maps, code editors, media players), wrap it in a `card` or `card-body` container with semantic colors applied to the wrapper only. Do not force non-UI elements into daisyUI components.

Load only what you need:

- `references/workflows/component-composition.md` — dashboard, landing page, and e-commerce patterns
- `references/workflows/responsive-layouts.md` — breakpoint strategies, grid patterns
- `references/common-mistakes.md` — "do this, not that" quick reference

## Workflow — Figma to daisyUI

This sequence is mandatory.

1. **FETCH**
   - Call `daisyui-blueprint-Figma-to-daisyUI`
   - Prefer a node-specific Figma URL (`?node-id=X-Y`)
   - Start with `depth: 3-5`; increase only if the tree is too shallow
   - Use `includeImages: false` unless image references are required
2. **ANALYZE**
   - layout direction and alignment
   - spacing and padding
   - component candidates
   - typography scale
   - corner radius, shadows, and color roles
3. **GET SNIPPETS**
   - Batch all identified components in one call (~8 items max)
   - If example names are unknown, fetch `components` first, then the exact `component-examples`
4. **BUILD**
   - Map Figma structure to daisyUI components + Tailwind layout classes
   - Use semantic colors instead of hardcoded hex on UI surfaces
   - Add responsive breakpoints explicitly
5. **RECOVER IF NEEDED**
   - If the node tree is too shallow, re-fetch with higher depth
   - If the file is large/noisy, switch to a more specific node URL
   - If a Figma element has no daisyUI equivalent, use raw Tailwind wrapped in a semantic container (see recovery rules)

Load only what you need:

- `references/workflows/figma-to-code.md` — step-by-step Figma extraction guide
- `references/tool-api-reference.md` — MCP tool parameters and auth setup
- `references/component-catalog.md` — full class/modifier reference when lookup is needed

## Workflow — screenshot or mockup to daisyUI

1. **Scan top-to-bottom**: navbar/header, hero, sidebar, main content, footer/dock.
2. **Identify the page shell first** before individual components. Check if a `template` or `layout` matches the overall structure.
3. **Catalog visible patterns**:
   - component type
   - likely variant
   - size
   - semantic color role
   - visible state
4. **Fetch components and only the best-matching examples** (~8 items max per call).
5. **Assemble the shell first**, then fill details and tune spacing/color.
6. **For non-daisyUI elements** (charts, graphs, maps, video players): note them as `<!-- TODO: integrate [chart library] here -->` inside a `card` wrapper with appropriate sizing. Do not attempt to recreate them with daisyUI components.
7. **If an interaction is not visible**, choose the most likely CSS-only daisyUI pattern and state the assumption.

Load only what you need:

- `references/workflows/screenshot-to-code.md` — full screenshot conversion workflow
- `references/prompts/screenshot-prompt.md` — agent prompt for screenshot analysis
- `references/component-catalog.md` — class validation when uncertain
- `references/common-mistakes.md` — avoid frequent errors

## Workflow — theme generation

1. **Determine the source**: brand palette, image, existing website, or Figma tokens.
2. **Map source colors to daisyUI semantics**:
   - `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`
   - `neutral`
   - `base-100`, `base-200`, `base-300`, `base-content`
   - `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`
3. **Generate matching `*-content` colors** with accessible contrast.
4. **Output `@plugin "daisyui/theme"` CSS in OKLCH.**
5. **Validate with semantic component usage**; do not leave UI surfaces on raw Tailwind colors.
6. **If building branded UI**, theme first, then fetch templates/components so the markup stays semantic.

Load only what you need:

- `references/workflows/theme-generation.md` — end-to-end theme workflow
- `references/theming/custom-themes.md` — variable reference and design presets
- `references/theme-and-colors.md` — color system architecture
- `references/prompts/image-to-theme-prompt.md` — image-to-OKLCH extraction prompt
- `references/tool-api-reference.md` for `themes` category usage

## Recovery rules — if the agent starts drifting

- **Snippets tool returns nothing or empty** → check nested object syntax first; arrays fail silently.
- **You do not know an example key** → fetch the `components` category for that component; example keys are listed in the response.
- **Generated classes look plausible but unverified** → validate via `components` category or `references/component-catalog.md`.
- **You are making too many MCP calls** → batch them (~8 items max) and mix categories in one call.
- **A full page is forming from unrelated snippets** → stop and restart from a `template` or `layout`.
- **The MCP server or Figma tool errors on setup/auth** → check `references/tool-api-reference.md`, especially MCP config and `FIGMA` requirements.
- **Markup uses `bg-blue-500`, `text-white`, or `dark:` on themed UI** → replace with semantic color classes (`bg-primary`, `text-primary-content`) or a custom theme.
- **You added JS for a standard drawer/modal/dropdown** → switch back to the CSS-only daisyUI mechanism.
- **You see v4 terms** like `form-control`, `input-bordered`, `label-text`, `tabs-lifted`, or `btm-nav` → convert to v5 equivalents and load `references/integration/v4-to-v5-migration.md`.
- **You start copying bulky examples into this skill** → stop and route to the relevant reference instead.
- **A UI element has no daisyUI equivalent** (chart, map, code editor, media player) → wrap it in a semantic container (`card`, `card-body`) with a TODO comment. Do not invent daisyUI classes.
- **Output is for React/Next.js but uses HTML attributes** → apply rule 12 (framework adaptation).
- **MCP response is huge (>10 KB)** → you fetched too many items. Reduce batch size and be more targeted.

## Exit checklist

Before finishing, verify each item passes:

| Check | Pass criteria |
|---|---|
| Snippet syntax | Every `daisyui-blueprint-daisyUI-Snippets` call uses `{ "category": { "name": true } }` — no arrays, no string values |
| Category choice | `components` used for class lookup; `component-examples` for markup; `templates`/`layouts` for page shells; not mixed up |
| Batch efficiency | All needed snippets fetched in ≤3 MCP calls total (not one call per component) |
| daisyUI v5 classes | Zero occurrences of `form-control`, `input-bordered`, `label-text`, `tabs-lifted`, `btm-nav`, or other v4-only classes |
| Semantic colors | All themed surfaces use `bg-base-*`, `text-base-content`, `bg-primary`, etc. — no raw Tailwind colors (`bg-blue-500`) on daisyUI components |
| `dark:` usage | Zero `dark:` prefixes on daisyUI semantic colors; `dark:` only used for custom non-theme utilities |
| Layout starting point | Page-level work started from a `template` or `layout`, not assembled from individual components |
| Figma sequence | If Figma was involved: FETCH → ANALYZE → GET SNIPPETS → BUILD sequence was followed in order |
| Framework adaptation | If target is React/Next.js/Vue/Svelte: `class`→`className`, `for`→`htmlFor`, self-closing tags, etc. |
| Reference efficiency | Only 1–3 reference files were loaded for this task, not the full set |
