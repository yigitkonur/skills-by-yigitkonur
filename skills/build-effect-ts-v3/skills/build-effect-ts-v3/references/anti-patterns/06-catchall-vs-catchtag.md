# CatchAll Instead of CatchTag
Use this when code catches every failure even though the error channel has specific tagged failures.

## Symptom — Bad Code
```typescript
import { Data, Effect } from "effect"

class UserNotFoundError extends Data.TaggedError("UserNotFoundError")<{ readonly id: string }> {}
class DatabaseError extends Data.TaggedError("DatabaseError")<{ readonly reason: string }> {}

declare const loadUser: Effect.Effect<{ readonly id: string }, UserNotFoundError | DatabaseError>

const recovered = loadUser.pipe(
  Effect.catchAll(() => Effect.succeed({ id: "anonymous" }))
)
```

## Why Bad
The handler treats an expected missing user and a database outage as the same thing.
Known tags let callers recover narrowly and leave unrelated failures visible.
A catch-all belongs at translation boundaries or after narrower handlers.

## Fix — Correct Pattern
```typescript
import { Data, Effect } from "effect"

class UserNotFoundError extends Data.TaggedError("UserNotFoundError")<{ readonly id: string }> {}
class DatabaseError extends Data.TaggedError("DatabaseError")<{ readonly reason: string }> {}

declare const loadUser: Effect.Effect<{ readonly id: string }, UserNotFoundError | DatabaseError>

const recovered = loadUser.pipe(
  Effect.catchTag("UserNotFoundError", () => Effect.succeed({ id: "anonymous" }))
)
```

## Review Checklist
1. Check the Effect success, error, and requirement types before editing.
2. Repair the smallest expression that creates the anti-pattern.
3. Keep imports from the `effect` barrel or a named v3 package.
4. Do not hide the issue with casts or ambient defaults.
5. Do not add a runtime call inside library or service code.
6. Keep tagged failures visible until a real boundary translates them.
7. Keep service requirements visible until a real layer provides them.
8. Use Config for configuration and redaction for secrets.
9. Use Option for expected absence and match both cases.
10. Use scoped resource constructors when cleanup is required.
11. Bound dynamic parallel work with explicit concurrency.
12. Use typed schema decoding at unknown boundaries.
13. Prefer Effect logging over direct platform diagnostics.
14. Prefer named layer constants over inline live layer construction.
15. Source-check unfamiliar APIs against the cloned v3 source.
16. If community guidance conflicts with source, follow source.
17. Keep the negative example narrow and the fix complete.
18. Route full positive design to the linked reference.
19. After editing, run leakage and deprecated-import greps.
