# Scenario detection — classify before scaffolding

Pick exactly one scenario per deployable app. Single-app projects get one final tag. Monorepos get one tag per deployable app plus a dominant root orchestration tag. Run the signal commands top-to-bottom, take the first supported match, and stop. Ambiguity is resolved with one targeted question — never a guess.

Before applying this reference, run the bundled read-only helper from the skill directory:

```bash
bash scripts/scenario-detect.sh /path/to/project
```

Use its observed signals as evidence, not as the final answer.

## How to read this file

For each scenario A–G:
- **Primary signals** — must be present. If any one of these matches, the scenario is in play.
- **Secondary signals** — nice-to-have evidence; raises confidence but isn't load-bearing.
- **Exclusion signals** — must NOT be present. If any of these match, it's a different scenario.
- **Typical deps** — exact expected `package.json` keys (or equivalent).
- **Typical config files** — what to check for on disk.

All commands assume the project root as `cwd`. Replace nothing — copy and paste.

## Classification result contract

Before generating files, print this block:

```text
Scenario: <A-G, or C+D for supported combined shape>
Scope: <repo root or per-app paths>
Confidence: <high|medium>
Signals: <observed files/deps/commands>
Excluded scenarios: <why the near misses were rejected>
Provider scope: <Vercel/Railway/Supabase/MacBook/local-only>
Makefiles to generate: <root + app paths, max 4>
Ambiguity resolved: <none or the answered question>
```

## Scenario A — Frontend-only

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary signals | `next.config.{js,ts,mjs}` exists; OR `vite.config.{js,ts}`; OR `astro.config.*`; OR `nuxt.config.*`; OR `svelte.config.*`; OR `remix.config.*`; OR `app/` + `page.tsx`; OR `pages/` + `_app.{js,tsx}` |
| Secondary signals | `.vercel/` directory present; `vercel.json`; `public/` static dir; `next-env.d.ts` |
| Exclusion signals | `apps/api`, `apps/server`, `services/` with HTTP framework deps; `supabase/` dir; `*.xcodeproj`; `Cargo.toml` at root; `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` in deps |
| Typical deps | `next`, `react`, `react-dom`; OR `vite`, `vue`/`svelte`; OR `astro` |
| Typical configs | `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.*`, `postcss.config.*`, `vercel.json` (optional) |

```bash

jq -r '.dependencies | keys[]?' package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'modelcontextprotocol|^mcp-use$'
```

### Scenario A — provider variant (Vercel is the default; Cloudflare Pages is opt-in)

**Default: Vercel.** Generate `makefile-frontend.md` deploy targets unless the user has explicitly asked for Cloudflare Pages. Disk signals alone do **not** flip the default — `wrangler.toml` is commonly present to drive R2 or Workers in a project whose frontend still ships to Vercel.

| User intent (the only thing that flips the default) | Provider to generate |
|---|---|
| User explicitly says "Cloudflare", "Pages", "Wrangler", or names the Pages product | Cloudflare Pages — read `makefile-cloudflare-pages.md` |
| User explicitly says "Vercel" | Vercel — read `makefile-frontend.md` |
| **User says nothing about provider** | **Vercel — read `makefile-frontend.md`. Do NOT ask, do NOT auto-detect.** |

Disk signals are **evidence**, not **deciders**. Print them in the classification block to help the user spot stale config or unintended setup, but treat them as below:

| Signal observed | What to do |
|---|---|
| `wrangler.toml` / `wrangler.jsonc` exists | Inform the user it's there; **do not switch from Vercel unless the user explicitly asks.** It may be R2-only or Workers-only. |
| `wrangler.toml` has `pages_build_output_dir` | Strong evidence of an existing Pages setup. Even so, confirm with the user before switching from Vercel default — they may be in the middle of a migration. |
| `public/_redirects` exists | Pages-specific routing file. Same rule: inform, do not switch silently. |
| `.vercel/` or `vercel.json` present | Confirms the default. No action needed. |
| Both Vercel and Cloudflare signals present | One disambiguation question (case 8 below). |

```bash
# Inspect (read-only; never decides — just informs)
ls wrangler.toml wrangler.jsonc public/_redirects .vercel vercel.json 2>/dev/null
grep -l 'pages_build_output_dir' wrangler.* 2>/dev/null
```

After the provider is set, route to either `makefile-frontend.md` (Vercel) or `makefile-cloudflare-pages.md` (CF). The shared targets (`local`, `local-lan`, `tunnel`, `stop`, `clean`) come from `makefile-frontend.md` either way; only the deploy targets diverge.

Independent of the provider choice: if the project ships large media (audio, video, raw images) and the user has named an R2 bucket or wants media on a custom domain, add the targets from `makefile-r2-bulk.md`. R2's S3-compatible API and custom-domain reads work the same with Vercel-hosted or Pages-hosted frontends — there is no coupling between the frontend host and R2.

## Scenario B — MCP server (local-facing service)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary signals | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` in `dependencies`; OR `mcp-use` in deps; OR `package.json` `bin` field points at an MCP entry; OR `Server` constructor from MCP SDK in source |
| Secondary signals | `bin` script in `package.json`; `src/index.ts` exports an MCP `Server`; entry script ends with `server.connect(transport)` |
| Exclusion signals | Public HTTP framework signals beyond MCP transport; `next.config.*`; `vite.config.*`; `apps/api`; `supabase/` dir; `.xcodeproj` |
| Typical deps | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `zod`, optionally `mcp-use` |
| Typical configs | `tsconfig.json`, `package.json` with a `bin` field, `mcp.json` (optional) |

```bash
# Primary
jq -r '.dependencies | keys[]?' package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'modelcontextprotocol|^mcp-use$'
jq -r '.bin' package.json 2>/dev/null
grep -RIl --include='*.ts' --include='*.js' '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk' src/ 2>/dev/null | head -3

# Exclusions
ls next.config.* vite.config.* 2>/dev/null
find apps server services -maxdepth 2 -name 'package.json' 2>/dev/null
```

## Scenario C — Frontend + custom backend

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary signals | A signals (any) AND a backend dir (`apps/api`, `apps/server`, `services/<name>`, `server/`) with HTTP framework deps in its `package.json` |
| Secondary signals | `turbo.json`; `pnpm-workspace.yaml` listing both `apps/web` and `apps/api`; root `package.json` has `workspaces` array; `railway.toml` in the backend dir |
| Exclusion signals | `supabase/` dir (would make it D unless backend is *also* present, in which case ask); only one app dir; backend has no HTTP deps |
| Typical deps | Frontend: `next` (or A-equivalent); backend: `express`, `hono`, `fastify`, `koa`, `@nestjs/core`, `tsx` |
| Typical configs | `turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `apps/web/`, `apps/api/`, `apps/api/railway.toml` |

```bash
# Primary
ls next.config.* vite.config.* 2>/dev/null  # frontend
find apps server services -maxdepth 2 -name 'package.json' 2>/dev/null | while read f; do
  jq -r 'select(.dependencies | (has("express") or has("hono") or has("fastify") or has("koa") or has("@nestjs/core"))) | input_filename' "$f"
done

# Secondary
ls turbo.json pnpm-workspace.yaml 2>/dev/null
jq -r '.workspaces' package.json 2>/dev/null
```

## Scenario D — Frontend + Supabase

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary signals | A signals AND `@supabase/supabase-js` (or `@supabase/ssr`) in deps AND `supabase/` dir (or `supabase/config.toml`) |
| Secondary signals | `supabase/migrations/` with at least one `.sql`; `supabase/functions/`; `src/db/types.ts`; `.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` |
| Exclusion signals | A custom backend dir with HTTP framework deps (would make it C+D — ask) |
| Typical deps | `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`, `next` |
| Typical configs | `supabase/config.toml`, `supabase/migrations/`, `supabase/functions/`, `next.config.*` |

```bash
# Primary
ls supabase/config.toml 2>/dev/null
jq -r '.dependencies | keys[]?' package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^@supabase/'
ls next.config.* vite.config.* 2>/dev/null

# Secondary
ls supabase/migrations 2>/dev/null
ls supabase/functions 2>/dev/null
```

## Scenario E — Multi-service Railway backend

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary signals | No frontend deps at root (or frontend lives in a separate repo); AND multiple service dirs (`apps/api`, `apps/worker`, `apps/cron`); OR multiple `railway.toml` files; OR project declared as Railway monorepo |
| Secondary signals | `Dockerfile` per service; `prisma/`; `bullmq` / `bull` in worker deps; `node-cron` / cron-runner in cron service deps |
| Exclusion signals | `next.config.*` at root; only one service dir; `supabase/` dir (Supabase belongs to D); `*.xcodeproj` |
| Typical deps | Per-service: `express`/`hono`/`fastify`, `bullmq`, `pg`/`prisma`, `ioredis` |
| Typical configs | `apps/api/railway.toml`, `apps/worker/railway.toml`, `apps/cron/railway.toml`, optional root `turbo.json` |

```bash
# Primary
find . -maxdepth 4 -name 'railway.toml' -not -path './node_modules/*' 2>/dev/null
ls apps/api apps/worker apps/cron services/* 2>/dev/null
ls next.config.* 2>/dev/null  # absent expected

# Secondary
find apps services -maxdepth 2 -name 'Dockerfile' 2>/dev/null
find apps services -maxdepth 2 -name 'package.json' -exec \
  jq -r 'select(.dependencies | (has("bullmq") or has("bull") or has("node-cron"))) | input_filename' {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

## Scenario F — Build-artifact app (no remote)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary signals | `Cargo.toml`; OR `go.mod`; OR `Package.swift` WITHOUT a macOS app target; OR `CMakeLists.txt`; OR `Makefile.am`. AND no HTTP framework. AND no deploy target in scope. |
| Secondary signals | `src/main.rs`; `cmd/<name>/main.go`; `Sources/<name>/main.swift`; release binary path matches a CLI convention (`bin/`, `target/release/`) |
| Exclusion signals | `package.json` with a web framework; `next.config.*`; `apps/api`; `supabase/`; `*.xcodeproj` with a real GUI app target |
| Typical deps (Rust) | `clap`, `anyhow`, `tokio` (CLI); for Go: `cobra`, `urfave/cli` |
| Typical configs | `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Package.swift`, `CMakeLists.txt` |

```bash
# Primary
ls Cargo.toml go.mod Package.swift CMakeLists.txt Makefile.am 2>/dev/null

# Distinguish F (CLI) vs G (Mac app) when Package.swift is present
grep -E 'platforms|macOS|\.executable|\.app' Package.swift 2>/dev/null | head

# Exclusions
ls next.config.* vite.config.* 2>/dev/null
find apps server services -maxdepth 2 -name 'package.json' 2>/dev/null
```

## Scenario G — MacBook artifact transfer

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary signals | `*.xcodeproj` / `*.xcworkspace` directory; OR `Package.swift` with macOS target; OR `package.json` with `electron-builder` / `electron-forge` and a `mac` builder block. AND user has indicated remote-Mac target (or `Host macbook` in `~/.ssh/config`) |
| Secondary signals | `Info.plist` with `CFBundleName`; `.app` build outputs in `build/Release/` or `out/<name>-darwin-*/`; entitlements file; signed/notarized release script |
| Exclusion signals | No `~/.ssh/config` entry for a Mac alias AND user hasn't named one (Scenario G requires a remote target — without it, fall back to F) |
| Typical deps (Electron) | `electron-builder`, `electron-forge`, `electron` |
| Typical configs | `*.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`, `Package.swift` (macOS target), `forge.config.*`, `electron-builder.yml`, `Info.plist` |

```bash
# Primary
ls *.xcodeproj *.xcworkspace Package.swift 2>/dev/null
jq -r '.devDependencies | keys[]?' package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'electron-builder|electron-forge|^electron$'
grep -E 'platforms|\.macOS|\.app' Package.swift 2>/dev/null | head

# SSH alias (skill assumes alias is already configured)
grep -iE '^Host macbook' ~/.ssh/config 2>/dev/null
ssh -G macbook 2>/dev/null | awk '/^hostname / {print $2}'   # not literally "macbook" → alias resolved
```

## Decision tree (single-app projects, first match wins)

```
1. *.xcodeproj OR Package.swift (macOS target) OR electron-builder?
   YES → Mac alias exists or user named one?
         YES → Scenario G
         NO  → Scenario F  (build local; no ship)
   NO → continue
2. Cargo.toml / go.mod / CMakeLists.txt / Makefile.am AND no web framework?
   YES → Scenario F
   NO → continue
3. @modelcontextprotocol/sdk OR mcp-use OR MCP Server constructor in src?
   YES → Scenario B
   NO → continue
4. Frontend signals AND supabase/ dir?
   YES → custom backend dir also present?
        YES → C+D only if backend deploys separately; otherwise ask (see below)
         NO  → Scenario D
   NO → continue
5. Frontend signals AND backend dir with HTTP framework?
   YES → Scenario C
   NO → continue
6. Frontend signals only (no backend dir, no Supabase)?
   YES → Scenario A
   NO → continue
7. Multiple service dirs / multiple railway.toml / no frontend?
   YES → Scenario E
   NO → ambiguous → ask the catch-all question (below)
```

## Monorepo branching rule

If the repo is a monorepo (`apps/` or `packages/` plus `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `turbo.json` / `nx.json` at root):

1. Run the decision tree against EACH app directory independently. Each app gets its own scenario tag.
2. Pick the **dominant scenario** for the root Makefile (usually the highest-traffic public-facing app — frontend > backend > tooling).
3. Generate one root `Makefile` plus up to three app sub-Makefiles, each scoped to its app. The root delegates via `$(MAKE) -C apps/<name> <target>`. See `makefile-base.md` for the helper convention and the monorepo reference for delegation patterns.
4. If the monorepo has more than three deployable apps, ask the user to pick three for now. The "max 4 Makefiles" ceiling is hard: root + up to three app Makefiles.

```bash
# Monorepo signal
ls pnpm-workspace.yaml turbo.json nx.json 2>/dev/null
jq -r '.workspaces' package.json 2>/dev/null
ls apps/ packages/ 2>/dev/null

# Per-app classification
for dir in apps/*/; do
  printf '\n=== %s ===\n' "$dir"
  ( cd "$dir" && ls package.json railway.toml supabase/config.toml 2>/dev/null )
done
```

## Common ambiguous cases

The agent **never guesses**. It asks one binary or short-list question, waits for the answer, then proceeds. Each prompt below follows the pattern: "I see X. Does Y? (y/n)" or "I see X. Is it (a) … or (b) …?".

### 1. Next.js + `apps/api` (Express) + Turborepo

> "I see Next.js plus `apps/api` with Express. Does `apps/api` deploy to Railway, or is it a worker invoked from Supabase only? (a) Railway / (b) Supabase-only / (c) something else"

Pick: (a) → Scenario C; (b) → not Scenario C — usually D with workers folded into Supabase Edge Functions; (c) → ask follow-up.

### 2. Next.js + `supabase/` + a backend dir

> "I see Next.js + Supabase + a custom backend at `apps/api`. Does the backend deploy to Railway in addition to Supabase, or is `apps/api` only a build-time script? (a) deploys to Railway / (b) build-time only"

Pick: (a) → C+D combined (rare; root orchestrates frontend + backend + Supabase; provider scope is Vercel + Railway + Supabase; generate only the Makefiles allowed by the 4-file ceiling); (b) → Scenario D.

### 3. `Package.swift` with both CLI and macOS targets

> "I see `Package.swift` declares both a CLI target and a macOS app target. Which is the primary deliverable: (a) the CLI / (b) the macOS app?"

Pick: (a) → Scenario F; (b) → Scenario G if remote-Mac alias exists, else F with `make ship` deferred.

### 4. Mac project with web view embedded

> "I see a macOS app and `apps/web`. Does the app embed `apps/web` via WKWebView, or are they independent products? (a) embedded / (b) independent"

Pick: (a) → Scenario G primary; the web app is a build-time dependency, no Vercel deploy. (b) → both — pick primary scenario for the root, generate sub-Makefiles for each.

### 5. MCP server + a public HTTP route

> "I see `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and an HTTP server endpoint. Is this (a) local-only MCP / (b) hosted-MCP over HTTP+SSE?"

Pick: (a) → Scenario B; (b) → defer to `build-mcp-use-server` (hosted-MCP patterns) and refuse to generate generic deploy targets.

### 6. `railway.toml` at root + `next.config.ts` at root (single repo, no monorepo split)

> "I see `railway.toml` and `next.config.ts` at the same root. Is the Next.js app deployed to (a) Vercel / (b) Railway as a single service?"

Pick: (a) → Scenario A (Vercel) — `railway.toml` is leftover or for a related-but-deferred service; ask if it should be removed. (b) → Scenario C with the frontend self-hosted (rare; surface that `output: 'standalone'` plus `0.0.0.0:$PORT` are required).

### 7. No clear signals (catch-all)

> "I couldn't classify this project from on-disk signals. Is it primarily: (a) a web frontend / (b) a backend service / (c) a CLI tool / (d) a Mac app / (e) an MCP server / (f) something else (please describe)?"

Map: (a) → A; (b) → C or E depending on follow-up; (c) → F; (d) → G; (e) → B; (f) → ask follow-up to identify.

### 8. Scenario A: both Vercel and Cloudflare signals present

> "I see both `.vercel/` (or `vercel.json`) AND `wrangler.toml` with `pages_build_output_dir`. The default is Vercel — should I keep that, or switch `make deploy` to Cloudflare Pages? (a) Vercel (default) / (b) Cloudflare Pages"

Pick: (a) → `makefile-frontend.md` deploy targets; leave `wrangler.toml` alone (it may drive R2 or Workers, not Pages). (b) → `makefile-cloudflare-pages.md` deploy targets; flag `.vercel/` as stale and ask if it should be removed (don't delete autonomously). If the user wants both deploy paths available in one Makefile, refuse — that violates the "pick one" guardrail; the right shape is two repos or two app dirs.

**Note: when only `wrangler.toml` exists (no Vercel signals) but the user hasn't explicitly named Cloudflare/Pages, still default to Vercel.** `wrangler.toml` alone often means R2/Workers usage with a Vercel-hosted frontend. Do not ask in that case — just default to Vercel.

### 9. Cloudflare R2 bucket: single-tenant or multi-tenant?

(Only invoked when R2 is in scope, regardless of provider variant.)

> "I see an R2 bucket bound at `<custom-domain>`. Is this bucket dedicated to this project, or shared with other projects / data? (a) dedicated / (b) shared"

Pick: (a) → still default to `rclone copy` (additive) for the first upload; the user can switch the recipe to `rclone sync` later when comfortable. (b) → MUST use `rclone copy`; surface that the existing bucket contents won't be touched. Probe `rclone size + lsf` before first sync regardless; surface any publicly-readable secret-looking paths via `make r2-audit-public`.

## Rules for asking

- **Ask once.** One question per ambiguity. Don't chain three questions before generating.
- **Binary or short-list.** y/n, or labelled options (a)/(b)/(c). Avoid open-ended prompts.
- **State observed evidence.** Use "I see X" up front so the user can correct misperception in the same answer.
- **Never guess silently.** When ambiguous, refuse to start generation until the user answers. The cost of a guess is regenerating the wrong Makefile and burning the snapshot commit.

## Pre-generation checklist

After classifying:

- [ ] Scenario tag recorded (A–G)
- [ ] If C+D: custom backend deploys separately and Supabase is also in scope
- [ ] If monorepo: per-app tags recorded; dominant scenario picked for root; ≤3 sub-Makefile slots assigned
- [ ] Exclusion signals double-checked (no Supabase config in a C-tagged repo without Supabase deps; no `*.xcodeproj` in an F-tagged repo)
- [ ] Disambiguation answered if any ambiguous case applied
- [ ] Classification result block printed before any file is written
